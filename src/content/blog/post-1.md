Part of [Hotwire](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) are Turbo Frames. They allow you to insert a page, or just a part of it, into another page.
I've found this feature quite magical when it was released. ðŸª„
But it would be useful to apply some Css conditionally, based if the page was viewed standalone or within a turbo frame.
Previously, and still valid, way to do this was adding a wrapper/container class around the turbo-frame and nested the css within here.
With Tailwind Css this is easier to do. Let's take the following example from [Helptail](https://helptail.com/) (Spinal's internally developed email support tool for calm SaaS companies):
|Hello|Hello|
|---|---|
|sdfsdf|sdfdfsd|

This is the email composer on a standalone page.
